# React playground

Test repository to experiment with different React technologies

## Current experiments

- Server-side rendering using Express.js
- Hot module reloading in the browser
- Custom Webpack config
- Redux Sagas
- Lazy loading + code splitting using dynamic `import()` statements with React Loadable

## Getting started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm build`
3. Run `npm start` for production build, or run `npm start:dev` for development with reloading
